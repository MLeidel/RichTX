# RichTX
### Enhanced ContentEditable

Although __document.execCommand__ was never fully developed, it is still
implemented in most web browsers. When used with __contentEditable__ and __textarea__
you can embed a more robust document editor into web pages.

RichTX is a Javascript library, __richtx.js__, that can be used, like say,
a _fancy_ textarea that you might use when more advanced text formatting 
is wanted.

The following compares coding an HTML textarea and a RichTX:

```html
<!-- textarea -->

<textarea id="TA" wrap="on" spellcheck="false"></textarea>

<!-- RichTX -->

<div id="RTX1"></div>


```

'wrap' and 'spellcheck' are set to 'on' and 'false' by default for
the RichTX object.

To create, a RichTX object it must be instantiated and displayed.

Example (Javascript):

```javascript
  /* Instantiate RichTX object
      Each RichTX object consists of a DIV which will contain
      an overlapping contextEditable area and a textarea. */
      
  const Rtx1 = new RichTX("RTX1", "CE1", "TA1");
    
    /*  Values to initialize a RichTX object:
        1. ID of the DIV used for the RichTX
        2. ID of the RichTX contentEditable 
        3. ID of the RichTX textarea  */

  Rtx1.displayAtTarget();
  
  /*  This method is required to activate aRichTX object at
      the DIV that was set up. */

```
By default BOLD (ctrl-B), ITALIC (ctrl-I), and UNDERLINE (ctrl-U) 
are available with no further code needed.

RichTX provides several methods, variables, and a function for
developers to build-in many more text formatting features.

---

## Methods Provided

### displayAtTarget

RichTX_obj.displayAtTarget();

Example usage:
```javascript
Rtx1.displayAtTarget();

```
As shown above, this method displays the instantiated RichTX object onto the page.
Also two object ID become available for the developer:

- RichTX.CEobj
- RichTX.TAobj

Use these whenever the object ID is needed for the contentEditable or textarea in the RichTX object.
For example to set up a Ctrl-S (Save) for a specific RichTX:

```javascript
  Rtx2.CEobj.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if ((event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey) && event.key === 's') {
        event.preventDefault();
        txt = Rtx2.getText();
        // code to save txt ...
    }
  });
  
```


---

### switchView

RichTX_obj.switchView();

Example usage:
```html
<input type="button" onclick="Rtx1.switchView();" value="Switch" />

```
Toggles the contentEditable view and the HTML view.

---
### setText(_t_)

RichTX_obj.setText(text);

Example usage:

```javascript
  function rtx1Load() {
    // normally text fetched from a server file
    text = `
This is text that would be fetched from
an async call to read a server file.`;
    Rtx1.setText(text); // then put it into the RichTX object
  }

```
---

### getText()

RichTX_obj.getText();

Example usage:

```javascript
text = Rtx1.getText(); 

// text now has encoded URI components
// and is ready to be written to your file or database


```
---

## Function Provided

### RTXexec(command [,value])

RTXexec is a wrapper for a _document.execCommand()_ function.
Required values are a _command_, and for some commands a value is needed.
Commands are always strings. Values can be a string or a number.

Example:

```Javascript 

 RTXexec("Indent");  // starts indented text
 
 RTXexec("fontName", "Arial");  // start Arial font
 
 RTXexec("fontSize", 3);  // change font size (1-7)

```
Note that the RichRTX instance object is not required because the _document.execCommand_ scopes
the entire document. __The command is applied at the text insertion point of the contentEditable area in focus__
which is part of each RichRTX instance.

### backColor
Changes the document background color. In styleWithCss mode, it affects the background color of the containing block instead. This requires a <color> value string to be passed in as a value argument.

### bold
Toggles bold on/off for the selection or at the insertion point.

### contentReadOnly
Makes the content document either read-only or editable. This requires a boolean true/false as the value argument.

### createLink
Creates an hyperlink from the selection, but only if there is a selection. Requires a URI string as a value argument for the hyperlink's href. The URI must contain at least a single character, which may be whitespace.

### decreaseFontSize

### fontName
Changes the font name for the selection or at the insertion point. This requires a font name string (like "Arial") as a value argument.

replacing the block element containing the line if one exists 
Requires a tag-name string as a value argument. 
Virtually all block-level elements can be used.

only the least indented lines in the selection will be indented.

or splits the current block element into two.

## Concerning CSS

CSS can be applied to adjust height, width, colors, etc.
Apply CSS to both the contentEditable div and the textarea.
Note the height and width must be the same for both.

Example:

```html
<div id="RTX1"></div><br>
<script>
const Rtx1 = new RichTX("RTX1", "CE1", "TA1");
Rtx1.displayAtTarget();

```

```css
    #CE1 {
    	padding: 5px;
    	width: 95%; /* same as #TA1 */
    	height: 250px; /* same as #TA1 */
    	border: 1px solid navy;
    	overflow: auto;
    }
    #TA1 {
    	height: 250px; /* same as #CE1 */
    	width: 95%;   /* same as #CE1 */
    	background: #111;
    	color: lightgreen;
    	font: normal 10pt monospace;
    }

```
